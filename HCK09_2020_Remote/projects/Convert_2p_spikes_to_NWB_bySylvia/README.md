# Conversion of two-photon, spike, behavioural and stimulation data to NWB format

The data are associated with the publication [Arousal modulates retinal output](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30318-4) 
and are publicly available from [here](https://rdr.ucl.ac.uk/collections/Arousal_modulates_retinal_output/4934931).

## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

The data consist of several datasets: 2P imaging of retinal boutons, 2p imaging of neurons in superior colliculus, Neuropixels recordings from optic tract, and 
Neuropixels recordings from superior colliculus with simultaneous optogenetic manipulations. All datasets also contain behavioural data, stimulus parameters, and 
pre-processed data/intermediate results (e.g. fitted tuning curves). The aim of the project is to convert these data into the NWB format.
